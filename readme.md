### Installation
1. Fork this repository so that you can make it your own.
2. Replace the images in `/assets/images` with your own images.
3. Host it directly from GitHub using [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/).

### Uploading images
1. Upload transparent PNGs to `assets/images` - don't put anything in the folder except images you want to use!
2. Images will automatically be added via Jekyll.  Please note GitHub Pages may take a bit of time to update the page.

### Creating marquee
1. In OBS, create a browser source 4096px wide and capture the rolleypolley page
2. Apply a filter to the source to scroll
3. If updating CSS etc., make sure to refresh your browser cache (in source settings for OBS - to do this on chrome press ctrl-shift-R)
